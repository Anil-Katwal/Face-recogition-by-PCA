Face Recognition using MATLAB
Overview
Welcome to the Face Recognition project implemented in MATLAB! This repository contains code and resources for building a face recognition system using MATLAB, a powerful programming language widely used in engineering and scientific applications.

Features
Face Detection: Utilize MATLAB's image processing capabilities to detect faces in images.
Feature Extraction: Extract key facial features to create a unique representation of each face.
Recognition Algorithm: Implement a recognition algorithm to match faces based on extracted features.
User-friendly Interface: Intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.
Requirements
Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system. Additionally, the project may require specific toolboxes for image processing and computer vision. Check the requirements.txt or equivalent file for details.
use training and test image 
There is two kind of code . one for using MATLAB inbuilt function and other is from scratch
